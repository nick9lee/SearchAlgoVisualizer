 search algorithm visualizer

just an idea atm

have 3 types of search, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra algos
allow barriers to be built, and end/start points to be saved

hardest part is dealing with user interface - potentially use sprite kit, or have many small button that are layed in a stack view
each button represents a node, how will the nodes be set up? start with BFS then expand, but i think once one is implemented the rest will come easy.

if u finish, u should just buy a developers liscense cuz u in pretty deep by now
ooo and make an app using firebase next... cuz thats cool, then maybe check out full stack apps or web scraping. guess this is my new journal...
